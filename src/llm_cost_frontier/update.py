"""Track the Pareto frontier of LLM intelligence against measured cost per task.

Any model page on artificialanalysis.ai embeds the full comparison dataset for
every currently benchmarked model, including the measured cost per Intelligence
Index task. This module fetches one page, parses that payload, merges it into a
cumulative history, applies known price events, and writes the JSON and Atom
feed that the dashboard at llm-frontier.catalystneuro.com renders.

The history keeps every observed (date, cost, index) per model, appending an
observation whenever a value changes. Snapshots and tier records use the cost in
effect on each date, so price changes that happen after a model's release are
dated to when they were observed instead of being back-dated to the release.
Models that leave the live set keep their observations and are marked retired.

Standard library only, so it runs unattended in GitHub Actions.
